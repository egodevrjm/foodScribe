Simple recipe app with recipes stored in a json file. Code is SwiftUI. Opens on a category screen, clicking a category takes you to a list of recipes in that category. Clicking the recipes takes you to the recipe detail view.

Recipe detail view includes a timer (not working), favorite functionality (partially working), recipe serving update and ability to click for full view image.

## To do: 
- Fix timer
- Fix favorites (make persistent)
- Add 'add a recipe' button (or at least make the script to add a recipe work)
